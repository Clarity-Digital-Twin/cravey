## Vision

**Cravey is a private, judgment-free iOS app that helps cannabis users understand their relationship with cannabis—whether they want to monitor use, reduce consumption, quit entirely, practice harm reduction, or simply track metrics for self-awareness.**

---

## Target User

**Primary Persona:**
Someone who uses cannabis and wants to:
- **Monitor their use** - Track patterns and understand habits
- **Cut down** - Reduce frequency or amount consumed
- **Stop completely** - Quit cannabis use
- **Harm reduction** - Maintain use at a specific, intentional level
- **Track metrics** - Data-driven self-awareness without judgment

**Shared Characteristics:**
- Values **privacy** - Doesn't want data shared with companies or cloud services
- Wants **self-compassion** - No shame, no streaks that "break," no punishment language
- May be in **vulnerable moments** - Needs fast, simple UI during cravings
- Wants **evidence-based support** - MI (Motivational Interviewing) principles, not lecturing
- May be tech-savvy enough to use their own AI API key for coaching

---

## Core Problems Solved

1. **Hard to track cravings AND cannabis use without judgment or data privacy concerns**
   → Most apps require cloud accounts or sell data. Users want local-only tracking. Crucially, users need to log *cravings* (whether resisted or not) to celebrate wins and understand triggers.

2. **Hard to resist cravings in the moment**
   → Users want to record motivational content when sober (video/audio messages to their future self) and replay during cravings.

3. **Hard to see patterns and progress over time**
   → Users want visual metrics (charts, trends) to understand their usage behavior and craving patterns.

4. **Hard to access non-judgmental support**
   → Users want an MI-trained AI coach available 24/7, but without sharing data with the app maker.

5. **Hard to stay motivated without clear goals**
   → Users want to set their own goals (quit, reduce, monitor) and track progress toward them—without shame when goals shift.

## MVP Features (v1.0)

### 0. First Launch & Onboarding
**User Story:**
*"When I open the app for the first time, I want to understand what it does and grant only the permissions I'm comfortable with."*

**Functionality (✅ UPDATED 2025-10-18):**
- **Welcome Screen**
  - Brief intro: "Private, local-only cannabis tracking and support"
  - Privacy guarantee: "No cloud sync, no analytics, no data collection"
  - Clear value proposition: "Track patterns. Understand triggers. Make informed decisions."
- **Permission Requests**
  - Camera/Microphone (for motivational recordings)
  - Location Services (for environmental cue tracking)
  - Explained with clear "Why we need this" text
  - All permissions optional (app works without them)
  - **If denied:** Recording feature shows "Enable camera/mic in Settings to record" message. Location defaults to manual presets (Home/Work/Car/etc). User can still use all other features (logging, dashboard, AI chat).
- **Quick Tour** (Optional, Skippable)
  - 3-screen walkthrough of core features
  - "Log Cravings & Usage → Record Motivational Videos → See Your Patterns"

**Deferred to Post-MVP:**
- **Goal Setting** - Removed from onboarding to reduce friction and focus on polished logging experience first. Users simply start tracking, and patterns naturally emerge. Goals can be added in v1.1 once users are already engaged with core tracking.

**Why It Matters:**
Sets user expectations, builds trust around privacy, and removes commitment pressure. Users can explore their patterns without declaring a goal upfront. **"Just track" is a valid use case** - reduces barrier to entry.

---

### 1. Craving Logging
**User Story:**
*"I want to log when I experience a craving so I can understand triggers and track patterns."*

**Functionality (✅ FULLY VALIDATED 2025-10-18):**
- **Fast input form** - Log in <10 seconds
- **UI Pattern:** Single scrollable form (Apple Health/Calendar style) - SAME as Usage Logging
  - Core fields at top (no scrolling needed for quick log)
  - Optional fields below divider ("Details" section)

**REQUIRED FIELDS:**
- **Intensity** - 1-10 slider
  - 1-3: Mild (manageable, background)
  - 4-6: Moderate (uncomfortable, requires coping)
  - 7-9: Strong (urgent, high risk)
  - 10: Overwhelming (crisis)
- **Timestamp** - Auto "now", editable to any past date/time (warning if >7 days)

**OPTIONAL FIELDS (Below divider):**
- **Trigger** - Multi-select HAALT chips (see Appendix A)
  - Primary: Hungry, Angry, Anxious, Lonely, Tired, Sad
  - Secondary: Bored, Social, Habit, Paraphernalia
- **Location** - Single-select chips (GPS + presets, see Appendix A)
  - Current Location (GPS), Home, Work, Social, Outside, Car
  - **Clinical rationale:** Environmental cues are relapse predictors. Location patterns reveal high-risk scenarios for intervention.
- **Notes** - Freeform text (500 character limit)

**NO "outcome" field** - Craving is logged independently, NOT linked to usage

**Instant Feedback** - After logging:
- "💪 Logged. Every moment of awareness counts."

**Why It Matters:**
**Logging cravings reframes urges as *data points*, not failures.** Users track patterns without judgment. Location + trigger data reveals environmental cues ("people, places, things") for targeted behavioral interventions. UX parity with Usage Logging reduces cognitive load.

---

### 2. Cannabis Usage Logging
**User Story:**
*"I want to quickly log when and how I use cannabis so I can see patterns over time."*

**Functionality (✅ FULLY VALIDATED 2025-10-18):**
- **Fast input form** - Log in <10 seconds
- **UI Pattern:** Single scrollable form (Apple Health/Calendar style)
  - Core fields at top (no scrolling needed for quick log)
  - Optional fields below divider ("Details" section)

**REQUIRED FIELDS:**
- **Date/Time** - Auto "now", editable to any past date/time (warning if >7 days)
- **Method (ROA)** - List selection
  - 💨 **Bowls** (pipes, bongs)
  - 🚬 **Joints**
  - 🌿 **Blunts**
  - 🌬️ **Vape** (pens, cartridges)
  - 💎 **Dab** (rigs, concentrates)
  - 🍫 **Edible** (gummies, brownies, drinks)
- **Amount** - Picker wheel (context-aware per ROA)
  - *Bowls/Joints/Blunts:* 0.5 → 5.0 in 0.5 increments (10 options)
  - *Vape:* 1 → 10 pulls (10 options)
  - *Dab:* 1 → 5 dabs (5 options)
  - *Edible:* 5mg → 100mg in 5mg increments (20 options)

**OPTIONAL FIELDS (Below divider):**
- **Trigger** - Multi-select HAALT chips (see Appendix A)
  - Primary: Hungry, Angry, Anxious, Lonely, Tired, Sad
  - Secondary: Bored, Social, Habit, Paraphernalia
- **Location** - Single-select chips (GPS + presets, see Appendix A)
  - Current Location (GPS), Home, Work, Social, Outside, Car
- **Notes** - Freeform text (500 character limit)

**NO forced link to cravings** - Usage is logged independently

**Why It Matters:**
Understanding *when*, *how*, and *why* they use helps users identify patterns and make informed decisions about their consumption. Picker wheels are fast, consistent, and match user mental models. HAALT-based triggers capture clinically meaningful data.

---

### 3. Pre-Recorded Motivational Content
**User Story:**
*"I want to record a video or voice message to my future self when I'm sober, so I can watch/listen during a craving."*

**Functionality:**
- **Record Video/Audio Messages** - When NOT experiencing a craving
  - Simple tap-to-record interface
  - Max 2 minutes per recording (keeps file sizes manageable)
  - Auto-compression to 720p for video (reduces storage)
  - Title the recording (e.g., "Why I'm Taking a Break," "Remember Your Goals")
  - Add category (user-assigned): Motivational, Milestone, Reflection, Other
  - Add notes/context
- **Replay During Cravings** - Easy access during vulnerable moments
  - Large, clear "Play" button on home screen
  - List view organized by category and recency
  - Play count tracking (see which recordings help most)
- **Privacy** - All recordings stored locally in app's Documents folder (never uploaded)
- **Simple Management** - Delete recordings anytime

**Why It Matters:**
Hearing your own voice/seeing your own face when you're clear-headed is more powerful than generic motivational quotes. Creates a personal accountability loop and provides immediate support during vulnerable moments.

---

### 4. Progress Metrics Dashboard
**User Story:**
*"I want to see my usage and craving trends over time so I can understand my progress."*

**Functionality (✅ FULLY VALIDATED 2025-10-18):**

**Summary Card (Top of Dashboard):**
- Weekly high-level stats at a glance
  - "This week: 12 uses, 3 cravings"
  - "Top trigger: Bored"
  - Quick reference without scrolling

**Visual Charts & Metrics (Swift Charts):**

1. **Amount Trend Over Time** - Line chart
   - Shows if using more or less week-over-week
   - Reveals escalation or reduction patterns

2. **Usage Reduction/Change** - Comparison metric card
   - "Using 30% less than last month" OR "Usage increased 15%"
   - Context-aware (shows reduction or increase based on actual data)

3. **Trigger Breakdown** - Pie chart
   - Shows proportion of each trigger (40% Bored, 30% Anxious, 20% Habit...)
   - Applies to both usage and craving triggers combined

4. **Location Patterns** - Bar chart or list
   - Where use/cravings occur most (Home 40%, Car 30%, Work 20%...)
   - Reveals high-risk environmental cues

5. **Time of Day Patterns** - Bar chart
   - Morning vs afternoon vs evening distribution
   - Identifies temporal patterns

6. **Weekly Patterns** - Bar chart
   - Usage by day of week (Mon: 2, Tue: 1, Wed: 3...)
   - Shows which days are highest risk

7. **ROA Breakdown** - Pie chart
   - Method distribution (50% Bowls, 30% Vape, 20% Edibles...)
   - Tracks ROA switching (escalation indicator)

8. **Consecutive Days Tracking** - Streak card
   - Context-aware: "7 days used in a row" OR "5 days abstinent"
   - Shows current streak based on user's pattern

9. **Longest Abstinence Streak** - Milestone card
   - "Your best: 14 days"
   - Never resets, celebrates historical achievement

10. **Average Craving Intensity Over Time** - Line chart
    - Shows if cravings getting weaker/stronger week-over-week
    - Tracks improvement in craving severity

**UI/UX Details:**
- **Empty States** - If <7 days of data: "Keep logging! You'll see patterns after 7 days."
- **Date Range Filter** - Toggle between 7 days / 30 days / 90 days / All Time
- **Scrollable Dashboard** - Metrics organized by priority (summary card first)
- **Direct Log Access** - Tap any metric to view detailed logs (no daily count clutter on dashboard)

**Future Consideration:**
- Heatmap visualization (time-of-day + day-of-week combined - GitHub-style)

**Why It Matters:**
Seeing patterns over time helps users make intentional changes. **Environmental context** (location, time, triggers) reveals high-risk scenarios for intervention. **Behavioral tracking** (streaks, ROA switching, amount trends) shows escalation or improvement. Visual simplicity (pie/line/bar charts) provides quick insights without cognitive load. Focus on **trends, not single data points**.

---

### 5. Optional AI Support (Bring Your Own API Key)
**User Story:**
*"I want to chat with an MI-trained coach without sharing my data with the app developer."*

**Functionality:**
- **User Provides API Key** - OpenAI or Anthropic (user's own account)
  - Stored securely in iOS Keychain with biometric protection
  - Input validation detects key format (sk-... for OpenAI, sk-ant-... for Anthropic)
- **Fixed MI System Prompt** - Pre-configured, tested prompt (not customizable in MVP)
  - Motivational Interviewing expert for cannabis cravings
  - Non-judgmental, reflective listening, open-ended questions
  - Supports user autonomy and goal flexibility
- **Simple Chat Interface**
  - Text-only messages
  - Ephemeral sessions (no persistent conversation history for MVP)
  - Clear error messages for invalid keys, rate limits, or quota issues
- **Local Storage Only** - No chat data sent to Cravey servers (only to user's chosen AI provider)
- **Fully Optional** - Users can skip this feature entirely

**Why It Matters:**
24/7 access to evidence-based support without sacrificing privacy. Users control their own API costs and data. BYOK eliminates "free service = you're the product" problem.

---

### 6. Data Management
**User Story:**
*"I want full control over my data—I should be able to export it or delete it anytime."*

**Functionality:**
- **Export All Data** (Settings → Data Management)
  - Format: CSV (for spreadsheets) or JSON (for developers/researchers)
  - Includes: All usage logs, craving logs, recordings metadata (not video/audio files)
  - Share via iOS share sheet (AirDrop, email, save to Files)
- **Delete All Data** (Settings → Data Management → Advanced)
  - Confirmation dialog: "This cannot be undone. All logs and recordings will be permanently deleted."
  - Deletes: SwiftData database + all recording files
  - App resets to first-launch state
- **Delete Individual Entries** (in-app)
  - Swipe-to-delete on usage/craving logs
  - Long-press-to-delete on recordings

**Why It Matters:**
Data transparency builds trust. Users feel in control, reducing anxiety about privacy. Export enables sharing with therapists/doctors if desired.

## Out of Scope for MVP

### Not Included in v1.0 (Deferred to Post-MVP):
- **Cloud sync** - 100% local-only for privacy
- **Push notifications** - No reminders, no check-ins (reduces complexity, maintains privacy)
- **Persistent AI chat history** - Ephemeral sessions only for MVP
- **Customizable AI prompts** - Fixed, tested MI prompt only
- **Goal tracking** - Focus on polished logging + dashboard first; goals = v1.1 enhancement
- **Craving vs usage ratio** - Too granular, needs bulk data for meaningful patterns
- **Trigger combinations** - Trigger breakdown pie chart sufficient for MVP
- **Heatmap visualization** - GitHub-style contribution graph (time + day combined) = future enhancement
- **Social features** - No sharing, no community forums
- **Prescription tracking** - Medical cannabis features (future consideration)
- **THC potency tracking** - False precision, clinically useless (see CLINICAL_CANNABIS_SPEC.md)
- **Medical vs recreational distinction** - Triggers already capture "why" without stigma/judgment
- **macOS version** - iOS-only first (macOS planned for future)
- **Pre-populated motivational quotes** - User-generated content only (may add later)
- **Integration with other apps** - No HealthKit, no calendar sync (future consideration)
- **Accessibility audit** - Will add VoiceOver/Dynamic Type support post-MVP after user testing

---

- **Sad** - Depression, grief, emotional pain

**Secondary Triggers:**
- **Bored** - Understimulated, nothing to do
- **Social** - Friends using, social context (not necessarily negative)

**Privacy:** First-time GPS use shows tooltip: "Location data never leaves your device"

---

## Appendix B: Data Relationships & Deletion Rules

### Craving ↔ Recording Relationship
**Structure:**
- Cravings can optionally reference recordings (many-to-one: multiple cravings can link to the same motivational video)
- Recordings exist independently of cravings (created during sober moments, not tied to specific craving events)

**Delete Behavior:**
1. **When user deletes a craving:**
   - Associated recording is NOT deleted (preserved for future use)
   - If recording was referenced by the craving, it remains accessible in Recordings library

2. **When user deletes a recording:**
   - Craving entries that referenced it remain intact
   - Craving data (intensity, timestamp, trigger, location, notes) is preserved
   - No cascading deletes

3. **When user selects "Delete All Data":**
   - All cravings, usage logs, AND recordings are permanently deleted
   - App resets to first-launch state

**Why These Rules:**
- **User Intent:** Deleting a craving log means "I want to remove this data point," not "delete my motivational content"
- **Data Integrity:** Recordings are valuable assets created intentionally, separate from spontaneous craving logs
- **Flexibility:** User can curate recordings independently without affecting historical logs

### Usage ↔ Craving Relationship (v1.3 UPDATE)
**Structure:**
- **Craving and Usage are INDEPENDENT logs** (no relationship, separate tracking)
- Users can log cravings only, usage only, or both - no forced connection
- No "outcome" field on cravings (removed to eliminate forced linkage)
- Supports all real-world patterns:
  - "I had a craving and didn't use" (log craving only)
  - "I used without a conscious craving" (log usage only)
  - "I tracked both" (log craving, then separately log usage)

**Delete Behavior:**
1. **When user deletes a usage log:**
   - Only that usage log is deleted
   - No impact on craving logs (separate data)

2. **When user deletes a craving log:**
   - Only that craving log is deleted
   - No impact on usage logs (separate data)
   - Recordings associated with that craving remain intact (see above)

**Why These Rules:**
- **Clinical Accuracy:** Many users experience cravings without using, or use without recognizing a craving
- **User Autonomy:** No forced decisions ("Did you use?" prompt creates pressure/shame)
- **Data Integrity:** Clean separation allows accurate tracking of both phenomena independently
