---

## üõ†Ô∏è What We're Building (Phase 6)

### Part 1: Onboarding Polish (Week 9, Days 1-2)

**Goal:** Refresh copy, visuals, and haptics so the existing onboarding flow feels production-ready and highlights all 6 features clearly.

#### Files to Modify (2 files)

1. **Update `Presentation/Views/Onboarding/WelcomeView.swift`**
   - Refine headline/tagline copy (consistent with App Store description)
   - Add subtle animation or hero illustration if missing
   - Reinforce privacy message ("100% local, zero tracking")
   - Ensure primary CTA uses new button style + haptics

2. **Update `Presentation/Views/Onboarding/TourView.swift`**
   - Audit slide copy/images (Craving Logging, Usage Tracking, Recordings, Dashboard with 5 metrics, Privacy)
   - Add progress indicator polish (PageTabView dots + accessibility labels)
   - Confirm Skip button, final CTA, and AppStorage flag still work
   - Localize strings where possible; prepare for future translations

---

### Part 2: UI/UX Polish (Week 9, Days 3-5)

**Goal:** App feels premium, responsive, delightful.

#### Files to Modify (Refinements across existing files)

**Animations:**
- Sheet transitions (CravingLogForm, UsageLogForm, RecordingView) - `.presentationDetents([.medium, .large])`
- Button feedback - `.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)` with `.animation(.spring())`
- List item animations - `.animation(.default, value:)` on state changes
- Chart transitions - Swift Charts built-in animations

**Haptic Feedback:**
- Success vibrations - `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator().notificationOccurred(.success)` after logging
- Slider changes - `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()` on intensity/amount changes
- Delete confirmations - `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator().notificationOccurred(.warning)`

**Empty State Polish:**
- HomeView empty state: Friendly illustration + "Log your first craving" CTA
- DashboardView empty state: "Log 7 days of data to see insights" with progress bar
- RecordingsLibraryView empty state: "Record your first motivational message"
- Use SF Symbols for icons (`hand.raised.fill`, `chart.bar.fill`, `mic.fill`)

**Error Handling Polish:**
- Toast messages (`.toast()` modifier) - "Craving logged successfully", "Recording saved"
- Retry logic for file I/O errors
- Graceful degradation for chart rendering failures (show placeholder)

---

### Part 3: Performance Optimization (Week 10)

**Goal:** All performance targets met, no memory leaks.

#### SwiftData Query Optimization (Days 1-2)

**Files to Modify:**
- `CravingRepository.swift` - Add predicates for date range filtering
- `UsageRepository.swift` - Add predicates for date range filtering
- `RecordingRepository.swift` - Add fetch limits (e.g., top 10 most-played)

**Optimizations:**
```swift
// Example: Fetch only last 90 days of cravings
let ninetyDaysAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -90, to: Date())!
let predicate = #Predicate<CravingModel> { craving in
    craving.timestamp >= ninetyDaysAgo
}
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<CravingModel>(predicate: predicate, sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.timestamp, order: .reverse)])
let results = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)
```

#### Chart Rendering Optimization (Day 3)

**Files to Modify:**
- `DashboardViewModel.swift` - Aggregate data before passing to charts (don't render 1000+ individual points)
- Use `.chartXScale(domain:)` and `.chartYScale(domain:)` to limit rendering

**Example:**
```swift
// Aggregate daily averages instead of individual logs
let dailyAverages = Dictionary(grouping: cravings, by: { Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: $0.timestamp) })
    .mapValues { $0.map(\.intensity).reduce(0.0, +) / Double($0.count) }
    .sorted(by: { $0.key < $1.key })
```

#### Memory Profiling (Day 4)

**Use Xcode Instruments:**
1. **Leaks:** Run Leaks instrument, log 100+ cravings, navigate between tabs - zero leaks expected
2. **Allocations:** Monitor memory growth, ensure <100 MB for 90 days of data
3. **File Handles:** Verify file handles closed after recording playback

**Fix Common Issues:**
- Ensure AVPlayer instances deallocated after playback
- Release large thumbnails from memory when not visible
- Use `@State` (not `@StateObject`) for SwiftUI observation

#### File Storage Optimization (Day 5)

**Files to Modify:**
- `FileStorageManager.swift` - Add cleanup for orphaned files (files with no DB entry)

**Optimizations:**
- Video compression (use `.compressionSettings` on AVAssetExportSession)
- Thumbnail generation at lower resolution (480x360 instead of full 1080p)
- Audio compression (use AAC codec at 128 kbps)

---

### Part 4: Accessibility Audit (Week 11, Days 1-2)

**Goal:** VoiceOver works for all critical flows, Dynamic Type scaling tested.

#### VoiceOver Labels

**Files to Modify (add `.accessibilityLabel()` and `.accessibilityHint()`):**
- `IntensitySlider.swift` - "Craving intensity, \(Int(intensity)) out of 10"
- `ChipSelector.swift` - "Trigger: \(trigger), \(isSelected ? "selected" : "not selected")"
- `CravingLogForm.swift` - "Log Craving button, submits form"
- `RecordingView.swift` - "Play recording, \(recording.title ?? "untitled")"
- `DashboardView.swift` - "Chart showing \(chartTitle)"

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Turn on VoiceOver (Cmd+F5 in Simulator)
- [ ] Navigate through craving log form using swipe gestures
- [ ] Verify all buttons have clear labels
- [ ] Test recordings playback with VoiceOver enabled

#### Dynamic Type Scaling

**Files to Modify (ensure `.font(.body)` instead of `.font(.system(size: 16))`):**
- All views should use `.font(.headline)`, `.font(.body)`, `.font(.caption)` (NOT fixed sizes)
- Test with Settings ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Larger Text ‚Üí XXXL

#### Color Contrast

**Validation:**
- Use Xcode Accessibility Inspector (Xcode ‚Üí Open Developer Tool ‚Üí Accessibility Inspector)
- Check contrast ratio ‚â•4.5:1 for normal text, ‚â•3:1 for large text
- Test both Light and Dark mode

---

- [ ] All Use Cases are protocol-based (testable)
- [ ] All ViewModels depend on Use Cases (NOT repositories directly)
- [ ] DependencyContainer is the only place dependencies are wired
- [ ] No business logic in Views (only presentation logic)

**Refactoring:**
- Extract any business logic from ViewModels to new Use Cases
- Move any hardcoded constants to dedicated files (e.g., `TriggerOptions.swift`)

#### Day 2: Unit Test Coverage Audit

**Goal:** Achieve 80%+ coverage across all features.

**Run Coverage Report:**
```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme Cravey \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -enableCodeCoverage YES \
  | xcbeautify
```

**View Coverage in Xcode:**
1. Open Report Navigator (Cmd+9)
2. Select latest test run
3. Click Coverage tab
4. Sort by % coverage (ascending)

**Fill Coverage Gaps:**
- Write tests for any Use Case with <80% coverage
- Write ViewModel tests for edge cases (error handling, empty states)
- Prioritize critical paths (craving log, usage log, export data)

**Target Test Count (from PHASE_OVERVIEW.md):**
- Phase 1: 9 tests (baseline)
- Phase 2: 14 tests (usage logging)
- Phase 3: 14 tests (onboarding + data management)
- Phase 4: 16 tests (recordings)
- Phase 5: 13 tests (dashboard)
- **Phase 6: 10 tests (onboarding + critical flows)**
- **Total: 76+ tests** (target 80%+ coverage)

#### Day 3: Documentation

**Code Comments:**
- Add inline comments for complex logic (e.g., date range filtering, chart aggregation)
- Document all public protocols with `/// Summary` and `/// Parameters:`

**Update README.md:**
```markdown
