## Vision

**Cravey is a private, judgment-free iOS app that helps cannabis users understand their relationship with cannabis‚Äîwhether they want to monitor use, reduce consumption, quit entirely, practice harm reduction, or simply track metrics for self-awareness.**

---

## Target User

**Primary Persona:**
Someone who uses cannabis and wants to:
- **Monitor their use** - Track patterns and understand habits
- **Cut down** - Reduce frequency or amount consumed
- **Stop completely** - Quit cannabis use
- **Harm reduction** - Maintain use at a specific, intentional level
- **Track metrics** - Data-driven self-awareness without judgment

**Shared Characteristics:**
- Values **privacy** - Doesn't want data shared with companies or cloud services
- Wants **self-compassion** - No shame, no streaks that "break," no punishment language
- May be in **vulnerable moments** - Needs fast, simple UI during cravings
- Wants **evidence-based support** - MI (Motivational Interviewing) principles, not lecturing
- May be tech-savvy enough to use their own AI API key for coaching

---

## Core Problems Solved

1. **Hard to track cravings AND cannabis use without judgment or data privacy concerns**
   ‚Üí Most apps require cloud accounts or sell data. Users want local-only tracking. Crucially, users need to log *cravings* (whether resisted or not) to celebrate wins and understand triggers.

2. **Hard to resist cravings in the moment**
   ‚Üí Users want to record motivational content when sober (video/audio messages to their future self) and replay during cravings.

3. **Hard to see patterns and progress over time**
   ‚Üí Users want visual metrics (charts, trends) to understand their usage behavior and craving patterns.

4. **Hard to access non-judgmental support**
   ‚Üí Users want an MI-trained AI coach available 24/7, but without sharing data with the app maker.

5. **Hard to stay motivated without clear goals**
   ‚Üí Users want to set their own goals (quit, reduce, monitor) and track progress toward them‚Äîwithout shame when goals shift.

## MVP Features (v1.0)

### 0. First Launch & Goal Setting
**User Story:**
*"When I open the app for the first time, I want to understand what it does, set my personal goal, and grant only the permissions I'm comfortable with."*

**Functionality:**
- **Welcome Screen**
  - Brief intro: "Private, local-only cannabis tracking and support"
  - Privacy guarantee: "No cloud sync, no analytics, no data collection"
- **Goal Selection**
  - "What brings you here today?"
    - üéØ **Quit Completely** - "I want to stop using cannabis"
    - üìâ **Cut Down** - "I want to reduce my usage"
    - üìä **Monitor Use** - "I want to understand my patterns"
    - ü§ù **Harm Reduction** - "I want to use more intentionally"
    - üëÄ **Just Exploring** - "I'm checking this out"
  - User can change goal later in Settings
- **Permission Requests**
  - Camera/Microphone (for motivational recordings)
  - Explained with clear "Why we need this" text
  - All permissions optional (app works without them)
  - **If denied:** Recording feature shows "Enable camera/mic in Settings to record" message. User can still use all other features (logging, dashboard, AI chat).
- **Quick Tour** (Optional, Skippable)
  - 3-screen walkthrough of core features
  - "Log Cravings ‚Üí Record Motivational Videos ‚Üí See Your Progress"

**Why It Matters:**
Sets user expectations, builds trust around privacy, and personalizes the experience from Day 1. Users feel in control.

---

### 1. Craving Logging
**User Story:**
*"I want to log when I experience a craving so I can understand triggers and track patterns."*

**Functionality:**
- **Ultra-Fast Input** - Log in <5 seconds
  - Big "Log Craving" button on home screen
  - Opens quick form with minimal fields
- **Data Captured:**
  - **Timestamp** - Auto-populated (not editable)
  - **Intensity** - 1-10 slider (required)
  - **Trigger** - Quick-select chips (optional)
    - Stress, Boredom, Social, Anxiety, Habit, Paraphernalia, Other
  - **Notes** - Optional freeform text
- **NO "outcome" field** - Craving is logged, that's it. No forced link to usage.
- **Instant Feedback** - After logging:
  - "üí™ Logged. Every moment of awareness counts."

**Why It Matters:**
**Logging cravings reframes urges as *data points*, not failures.** Users track patterns without judgment. Some users track cravings to understand triggers (quit-focused), others don't track them at all (usage monitoring only). This feature is optional and independent from usage logging.

---

### 2. Cannabis Usage Logging
**User Story:**
*"I want to quickly log when and how I use cannabis so I can see patterns over time."*

**Functionality:**
- **Fast input form** - Log in <10 seconds
- **Data Captured:**
  - **Date/Time** - Auto-populated, editable
  - **Method (ROA)** - Single-tap selection
    - üí® **Bowls** (pipes, bongs)
    - üö¨ **Joints**
    - üåø **Blunts**
    - üå¨Ô∏è **Vape** (pens, cartridges)
    - üíé **Dab** (rigs, concentrates)
    - üç´ **Edible** (gummies, brownies, drinks)
  - **Amount** - Simple incrementing count (see CLINICAL_CANNABIS_SPEC.md for validation)
    - *Bowls:* 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3... (half-increments)
    - *Joints:* 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3... (half-increments)
    - *Blunts:* 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3... (half-increments)
    - *Vape:* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... pulls (whole numbers)
    - *Dab:* 1, 2, 3, 4... dabs (whole numbers)
    - *Edible:* 10mg, 20mg, 30mg, 40mg... (10mg increments)
  - **Context/Trigger** - Optional quick-select chips
    - Stress, Social, Boredom, Anxiety, Celebration, Habit, Other
  - **Mood After** - Optional 1-10 slider ("How do you feel now?")
  - **Notes** - Optional freeform text
- **NO forced link to cravings** - Usage is logged independently

**Why It Matters:**
Understanding *when*, *how*, and *why* they use helps users identify patterns and make informed decisions about their consumption. Simple incrementing counts match user mental models and reduce friction.

---

### 3. Pre-Recorded Motivational Content
**User Story:**
*"I want to record a video or voice message to my future self when I'm sober, so I can watch/listen during a craving."*

**Functionality:**
- **Record Video/Audio Messages** - When NOT experiencing a craving
  - Simple tap-to-record interface
  - Max 2 minutes per recording (keeps file sizes manageable)
  - Auto-compression to 720p for video (reduces storage)
  - Title the recording (e.g., "Why I'm Taking a Break," "Remember Your Goals")
  - Add category (user-assigned): Motivational, Milestone, Reflection, Other
  - Add notes/context
- **Replay During Cravings** - Easy access during vulnerable moments
  - Large, clear "Play" button on home screen
  - List view organized by category and recency
  - Play count tracking (see which recordings help most)
- **Privacy** - All recordings stored locally in app's Documents folder (never uploaded)
- **Simple Management** - Delete recordings anytime

**Why It Matters:**
Hearing your own voice/seeing your own face when you're clear-headed is more powerful than generic motivational quotes. Creates a personal accountability loop and provides immediate support during vulnerable moments.

---

### 4. Progress Metrics Dashboard
**User Story:**
*"I want to see my usage and craving trends over time so I can understand my progress."*

**Functionality:**
- **Visual Charts** (Swift Charts) - Minimum 7 days of data to display meaningful trends
  - **Usage Frequency** - Bar chart showing daily/weekly usage count
  - **Craving Patterns** - Line chart showing craving count and intensity over time
  - **Resistance Rate** - Percentage of cravings resisted vs. used (pie chart or percentage)
  - **Method Breakdown** - Donut chart showing ROA distribution (e.g., "60% Smoke, 30% Vape, 10% Edible")
- **Progress Stats** (at-a-glance cards)
  - **Days in Progress** - Total days using the app (never resets from setbacks, always counts up; only resets if user manually deletes all data)
  - **Days Since Last Use** - Factual counter (if quitting)
  - **Cravings Resisted** - Total count of ‚úÖ Resisted outcomes
  - **Total Sessions Logged** - Combined usage + craving entries
  - **Reduction %** - Comparison of usage frequency (this week vs. first week)
- **Empty States** - If <7 days of data: "Keep logging! You'll see trends after 7 days."
- **Date Range Filter** - Toggle between 7 days / 30 days / 90 days / All Time

**Why It Matters:**
Seeing patterns helps users make intentional changes. Visual feedback motivates continued progress. **Tracking resistance rate celebrates wins and builds self-efficacy.** "Days in Progress" never resets‚Äîavoiding the psychological harm of "broken streaks."

---

### 5. Optional AI Support (Bring Your Own API Key)
**User Story:**
*"I want to chat with an MI-trained coach without sharing my data with the app developer."*

**Functionality:**
- **User Provides API Key** - OpenAI or Anthropic (user's own account)
  - Stored securely in iOS Keychain with biometric protection
  - Input validation detects key format (sk-... for OpenAI, sk-ant-... for Anthropic)
- **Fixed MI System Prompt** - Pre-configured, tested prompt (not customizable in MVP)
  - Motivational Interviewing expert for cannabis cravings
  - Non-judgmental, reflective listening, open-ended questions
  - Supports user autonomy and goal flexibility
- **Simple Chat Interface**
  - Text-only messages
  - Ephemeral sessions (no persistent conversation history for MVP)
  - Clear error messages for invalid keys, rate limits, or quota issues
- **Local Storage Only** - No chat data sent to Cravey servers (only to user's chosen AI provider)
- **Fully Optional** - Users can skip this feature entirely

**Why It Matters:**
24/7 access to evidence-based support without sacrificing privacy. Users control their own API costs and data. BYOK eliminates "free service = you're the product" problem.

---

### 6. Data Management
**User Story:**
*"I want full control over my data‚ÄîI should be able to export it or delete it anytime."*

**Functionality:**
- **Export All Data** (Settings ‚Üí Data Management)
  - Format: CSV (for spreadsheets) or JSON (for developers/researchers)
  - Includes: All usage logs, craving logs, recordings metadata (not video/audio files)
  - Share via iOS share sheet (AirDrop, email, save to Files)
- **Delete All Data** (Settings ‚Üí Data Management ‚Üí Advanced)
  - Confirmation dialog: "This cannot be undone. All logs and recordings will be permanently deleted."
  - Deletes: SwiftData database + all recording files
  - App resets to first-launch state
- **Delete Individual Entries** (in-app)
  - Swipe-to-delete on usage/craving logs
  - Long-press-to-delete on recordings

**Why It Matters:**
Data transparency builds trust. Users feel in control, reducing anxiety about privacy. Export enables sharing with therapists/doctors if desired.

## Appendix B: Data Relationships & Deletion Rules

### Craving ‚Üî Recording Relationship
**Structure:**
- Cravings can optionally reference recordings (many-to-one: multiple cravings can link to the same motivational video)
- Recordings exist independently of cravings (created during sober moments, not tied to specific craving events)

**Delete Behavior:**
1. **When user deletes a craving:**
   - Associated recording is NOT deleted (preserved for future use)
   - If recording was referenced by the craving, it remains accessible in Recordings library

2. **When user deletes a recording:**
   - Craving entries that referenced it remain intact
   - Craving data (intensity, trigger, outcome) is preserved
   - No cascading deletes

3. **When user selects "Delete All Data":**
   - All cravings, usage logs, AND recordings are permanently deleted
   - App resets to first-launch state

**Why These Rules:**
- **User Intent:** Deleting a craving log means "I want to remove this data point," not "delete my motivational content"
- **Data Integrity:** Recordings are valuable assets created intentionally, separate from spontaneous craving logs
- **Flexibility:** User can curate recordings independently without affecting historical logs

### Usage ‚Üî Craving Relationship
**Structure:**
- Usage logs can optionally link back to a craving (if user followed "Log what you used?" prompt)
- One-way reference: Usage ‚Üí Craving (for context: "This usage followed a craving")

**Delete Behavior:**
1. **When user deletes a usage log:**
   - Original craving entry remains intact with "Used" outcome
   - Removing usage detail doesn't change craving history

2. **When user deletes a craving that has linked usage:**
   - Prompt: "This craving has a linked usage log. Delete both?" (Yes / No / Cancel)
   - If Yes: Both deleted
   - If No: Only craving deleted, usage log preserved with no craving reference

**Why These Rules:**
- **User Control:** Clear about what's being deleted
- **Data Completeness:** Usage logs may have valuable context (method, amount, mood) worth preserving separately
