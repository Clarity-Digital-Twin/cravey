## 📋 Documentation Roadmap

### ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. `MVP_PRODUCT_SPEC.md` (v1.4) - **FULLY UPDATED** ✅
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25 (AI Chat removed, all UX flows complete)
**File:** `/docs/MVP_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
**What It Defines:**
- Vision, target users, core problems solved
- 6 MVP features (Onboarding, Craving Logging, Usage Logging, Recordings, Dashboard, Data Management)
- **AI Chat REMOVED** (gimmicky, API cost unsustainable, recordings feature provides better support)
- Success criteria (Technical, User, Ethical)
- Out of scope items (UPDATED with all deferred features including AI chat)
- **Appendix A:** ROA amounts, HAALT trigger categories, location presets (FULLY VALIDATED)
- **Appendix B:** Data relationship & deletion rules

**Key Decisions Made:**
- iOS 18+ only (initial release)
- Local-only storage (SwiftData with `.none` CloudKit)
- <10 sec for both craving and usage logging
- **CRITICAL:** Craving and usage logging are INDEPENDENT (no forced link)
- **UX Parity:** Both flows use same UI pattern (single scrollable form, Apple HIG)
- 6 ROA categories with validated picker ranges (Bowls/Joints/Blunts: 0.5→5.0, Vape: 1→10, Dab: 1→5, Edible: 5→100mg)
- HAALT-based triggers (Hungry/Angry/Anxious/Lonely/Tired/Sad + Bored/Social/Habit/Paraphernalia)
- Location tracking for BOTH craving & usage (GPS + 6 presets)
- **11 validated dashboard metrics** (summary card, amount trends, trigger/location/time/ROA breakdowns, streaks, craving intensity)
- **Goal tracking DEFERRED to post-MVP** (focus on polished logging first)
- **AI chat REMOVED from MVP** (deferred indefinitely, recordings are better)
- **THC potency tracking SKIPPED** (false precision, clinically useless)
- **Medical vs recreational distinction SKIPPED** (triggers capture "why" without stigma)
- Permission denial fallbacks documented
- Delete behavior for all relationships defined

**Why It's Done:**
- Provides north star for all other docs
- Defines product-level "what" before technical "how"
- 100% aligned with clinically validated tracking model
- All UX decisions documented with clinical rationale

---

#### 2. `CLINICAL_CANNABIS_SPEC.md` - **100% COMPLETE** ✅🔥
**Status:** ✅ All Clinical Validations Done
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18
**Owner:** Ray (Domain Expert - Psychiatrist/Addiction Medicine)
**File:** `/docs/CLINICAL_CANNABIS_SPEC.md`

**What It Defines:**
- ROA categories & amounts with UX-ready picker wheel ranges
- Craving intensity scale (1-10 slider with clinical interpretation)
- **CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Independent flows (craving logging ≠ usage logging)
- **Complete Craving Logging UX flow** (intensity, timestamp, triggers, location, notes)
- **Complete Usage Logging UX flow** (ROA, amount, timestamp, triggers, location, notes)
- HAALT-based trigger chips (multi-select, evidence-based)
- Location presets with GPS (single-select, privacy-first)
- UI pattern: Single scrollable form (Apple HIG) for both flows
- **Dashboard metrics validated** (11 metrics for MVP, 3 deferred to post-MVP)
- **Scope decisions resolved** (THC potency, medical/rec distinction, goal tracking)

**Key Decisions Made:**
- UX parity between craving & usage logging (learn once, use everywhere)
- Location tracking for BOTH flows (environmental cues = relapse prevention)
- Editable timestamps with >7 day warning (supports backdating for missed logs)
- 500 char limit on notes (focused reflection, not journaling)
- Removed "Mood After" from usage logging (redundant with triggers)
- Picker wheel consistency across all ROAs (simpler UX, less code)
- Dashboard focuses on patterns over time (trends, not single data points)
- Visual simplicity (pie/line/bar charts) for quick insights

**Why It's Done:**
- ALL core logging flows clinically validated and build-ready
- ALL dashboard metrics validated with clinical rationale
- ALL open questions resolved (THC potency, medical/rec, goals = deferred/skipped)
- Feeds into UX_FLOW_SPEC.md (wireframes) and DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md (SwiftData schemas)
- Domain expert validation 100% complete - ready for implementation

7. **✅ Flow 7: Settings Tab** (3 screens)
   - Main settings (simple iOS list pattern)
   - Export via Share Sheet (CSV/JSON)
   - Delete all data (single confirmation)
   - **AI chat removed** (not in Settings, not in MVP)

**Total Screens Designed:** 19 screens fully specified

**Major Design Decisions Locked:**

- RecordingModel (video/audio metadata)
- MotivationalMessageModel (pre-populated & custom messages)
- Relationships (Craving ↔ Recording, with `.nullify` delete rules)
- ModelContainer setup (CloudKit `.none` configuration)
- Query examples, performance optimization, migration strategy

**Key Decisions Made:**
- **Simple types** (String/Double/Int/Date/UUID/[String]) - no custom encodings
- **Arrays for multi-select** triggers ([String] not comma-separated)
- **Implied units** (amount: Double, unit derived from method in ViewModel)
- **GPS as strings** ("lat,long" format for location)
- **File paths relative** (not absolute) for RecordingModel
- **Default messages seeded** on first launch (11 motivational messages)
- **Lightweight migrations only** (additive changes, no breaking schema updates)

**Validation:**

#### 5. `TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (v1.2) - **COMPLETE** ✅
**Status:** ✅ Complete (with code refactors applied)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31

**File:** `/docs/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**What It Defines:**
- Complete feature-to-code mapping for all 6 MVP features
- Clean Architecture + MVVM layer structure (2025 best practices)
- 61 files to create (20 exist, all baseline refactors complete)
- Feature dependency graph (5/6 features are independent, can build in parallel)
- TDD workflow with Swift Testing framework (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Test pyramid (80% unit, 15% integration, 5% UI)
- 16-week implementation timeline (4 phases)
- Build & test commands (daily dev workflow)
- Performance targets (craving <5s, usage <10s, dashboard <3s)

**Key Decisions Made:**
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture + MVVM with `@Observable` (NOT `ObservableObject`)
- **Testing:** Swift Testing framework (`@Test` macro, WWDC24)
- **Dependency Injection:** Protocol-based, wired in DependencyContainer
- **TDD Workflow:** Write test first (RED) → Implement (GREEN) → Refactor
- **Feature Order:** Craving/Usage/Recordings parallel, then Dashboard (depends on data)
- **Component Reuse:** 8 reusable UI components (LogFormSheet, ChipSelector, etc.)
- **AVFoundation:** Audio first (simpler), then video (complex AVCaptureSession)
- **SwiftData Optimization:** Predicates for filtering, fetch limits for charts

**Implementation Roadmap (16 Weeks):**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Core logging (Craving, Usage, Onboarding, Data Management)
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Recordings (Audio → Video) + Dashboard
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Polish & Testing (UI/UX, performance, user testing)
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Launch Prep (TestFlight, App Store, v1.0 release)

## 🧠 Why This Order Makes Sense

### Traditional (Wrong) Order:
1. ❌ Write technical specs first
2. ❌ Start coding
3. ❌ Realize product model is wrong
4. ❌ Refactor everything

### Your (Correct) Order:
1. ✅ **Product spec** (what are we building?) → MVP_PRODUCT_SPEC.md
2. ✅ **Clinical validation** (is the model correct?) → CLINICAL_CANNABIS_SPEC.md
3. ✅ **UX flows** (how does it feel to use?) → UX_FLOW_SPEC.md
4. ✅ **Data models** (what do we store?) → DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md
5. ✅ **Implementation plan** (in what order?) → TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
6. 🎯 **Start coding** (with confidence) ← YOU ARE HERE

**This is called "Domain-Driven Design"** - the domain expert (you) validates the model before engineers build it.
