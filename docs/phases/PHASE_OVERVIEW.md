# Cravey Implementation Phases - Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** 🚀 READY TO START PHASE 1

---

## 🎯 Phase Strategy

This document breaks down the **TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md** into **6 modular, shippable phases**. Each phase:

✅ Can be **tested independently** (unit + integration + UI tests)
✅ Produces a **shippable deliverable** (users can do something new)
✅ Follows **TDD workflow** (write tests → implement → validate)
✅ Validates **Clean Architecture** compliance (Dependency Rule)

---

## 📦 Phase Breakdown (4 Phases, 16 Weeks Total)

### Phase 1: Foundation + Craving Logging ⏱️ 1 week (Week 1)
**Dependencies:** None (baseline code exists)
**Shippable:** Users can launch app, log cravings, view craving history
**Features:** Feature 1 (Craving Logging - complete)
**Files Created:** 15 files (5 foundation + 3 tabs + 5 components + 2 views)
**Tests:** 10 unit tests, 3 integration tests, 1 UI test (14 total)

**Key Deliverables:**
- UsageModel created (data model only, UI in Week 2)
- Empty tab bar shell (Home, Dashboard, Settings)
- CravingLogForm (full implementation)
- CravingListView (read-only list)
- Reusable components (IntensitySlider, ChipSelector, etc.)
- <5 sec craving log validated

**Note:** This phase covers **Week 1 only**. Usage Logging (Week 2), Recordings (Weeks 5-6), Dashboard (Week 8), and other features are in subsequent phases per TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md master timeline.

---

### Phase 2: Recordings + Dashboard ⏱️ 4 weeks (Weeks 5-8)
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (uses FileStorageManager + craving/usage data)
**Shippable:** Users can record motivational content, play it back, and visualize progress
**Features:** Feature 3 (Recordings) + Feature 4 (Dashboard)
**Files Created:** 18 files (13 recording files + 5 dashboard files)
**Tests:** 23 unit tests, 7 integration tests, 4 UI tests

**Key Deliverables:**
- AudioRecordingCoordinator (AVAudioRecorder)
- VideoRecordingCoordinator (AVCaptureSession)
- Recording library (with thumbnails)
- Audio/video playback
- Quick Play section (Home tab)
- FetchDashboardDataUseCase (aggregates data)
- 11 metric cards (Swift Charts)
- Date range filter (7/30/90 days)
- <3 sec dashboard load time validated

---

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing ⏱️ 4 weeks (Weeks 9-12)
**Dependencies:** Phases 1-2 (all features exist)
**Shippable:** Production-ready MVP (polished, tested, performant)
**Features:** UI/UX Polish + Performance Optimization + User Testing
**Files Created:** Refinements to existing files (no new files)
**Tests:** Achieve 80%+ unit test coverage across all features

**Key Deliverables:**
- UI/UX polish (animations, haptics, empty states, error handling)
- Performance optimization (SwiftData queries, chart rendering, memory profiling)
- Accessibility audit (VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type scaling, color contrast)
- User testing iteration (internal + external beta, feedback implementation)
- Code quality & documentation (Clean Architecture compliance, refactoring)

---

### Phase 4: Launch Prep ⏱️ 4 weeks (Weeks 13-16)
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 (production-ready MVP)
**Shippable:** Cravey v1.0 live on App Store
**Features:** TestFlight Beta + App Store Submission
**Files Created:** 2 onboarding views
**Tests:** 5 UI tests (critical flows)

**Key Deliverables:**
- TestFlight setup (App Store Connect record, beta builds, internal testing)
- External beta testing (10-20 testers, feedback prioritization, fixes)
- App Store assets (screenshots, description, privacy policy, support page)
- App Store submission & review
- 🚀 **LAUNCH** (release to public)

## 📊 Test Coverage Goals (Per Phase)

| Phase | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | UI Tests | Total | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Week 1) | 10 | 3 | 1 | 14 | Craving logging only |
| Weeks 2-4 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Usage, onboarding, data mgmt (docs pending) |
| Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8) | 23 | 7 | 4 | 34 | Recordings + Dashboard |
| Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12) | Achieve 80%+ | — | — | — | Coverage target |
| Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16) | 0 | 0 | 5 | 5 | Critical flow tests |
| **TOTAL** | **33+** | **10+** | **10+** | **53+** | Target: 80% coverage |

**Coverage Strategy:**
- **Phase 1:** Baseline test patterns established (14 tests for craving logging)
- **Weeks 2-4:** Build on Phase 1 patterns for usage/data management
- **Phase 3:** Comprehensive coverage audit and gap-filling to reach 80%+

## 🔄 TDD Workflow (Every Phase)

```
1. Write Test (RED) ❌
   - Unit test for use case
   - ViewModel test with mock use case
   - UI test for critical flow

2. Implement Minimal Code (GREEN) ✅
   - Domain layer (Entity, Use Case, Protocol)
   - Data layer (Model, Mapper, Repository)
   - Presentation layer (ViewModel, View)

3. Refactor (CLEAN) 🧹
   - Extract helpers
   - Improve naming
   - Add documentation
   - Verify tests still pass

4. Commit (ATOMIC) 📦
   - Small, focused commits
   - Commit message format: "[Phase X] Add feature Y"
   - Push to feature branch
```
