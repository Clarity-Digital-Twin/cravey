# Cravey UX Flow Specification

**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress - Mapping User Journeys (5/7 flows complete)

---

## 🔖 Purpose

This document maps **screen-by-screen user flows** for all 7 MVP features. It translates clinical requirements (CLINICAL_CANNABIS_SPEC.md) and product features (MVP_PRODUCT_SPEC.md) into **tangible UI patterns** that feel natural, fast, and compassionate.

**What This Document Defines:**
- Navigation architecture (tabs, modals, sheets)
- Screen layouts (wireframe descriptions, not pixel-perfect)
- State transitions (User taps X → Screen shows Y → If Z, then...)
- Error states, empty states, loading states
- Component reuse patterns (DRY principle)

**What This Document Does NOT Define:**
- Exact pixel dimensions or colors (implementation detail)
- Animation timing/curves (implementation detail)
- Specific SF Symbol names (implementation detail)

## 📐 General Design Guidelines (2025 SwiftUI Best Practices)

### **1. Architecture Patterns**

**Navigation:**
- **NavigationStack** (iOS 16+) - NOT NavigationView (deprecated)
- **Tab Bar** (4 tabs) - Persistent at bottom, hides when modal is open
  - Tab 1: **Home** (Quick action hub)
  - Tab 2: **Progress** (Dashboard with charts)
  - Tab 3: **Recordings** (Video/audio library)
  - Tab 4: **Settings** (Data management, AI chat, permissions)
- **Bottom Sheets** - For contextual, dismissible actions (Log Craving/Usage forms)
- **Full-Screen Modals** - For separate modes (Recording video/audio)
- **Alerts** - For destructive actions (Delete All Data confirmation)

**State Management:**
- `@Observable` for ViewModels (Swift 6)
- `@State` for local view state (picker selection, text input)
- Unidirectional data flow: User action → ViewModel → Update state → View re-renders

---

### **2. Component Library (Reusable UI Elements)**

**Purpose:** Consistent UI, less code, easier maintenance. Build once, use everywhere.

#### **Core Components (8 Total):**

1. **`LogFormSheet`** - Bottom sheet wrapper
   - Single scrollable `Form { }` (Apple Health style)
   - Auto-dismisses on save or swipe-down
   - Used by: Craving logging, Usage logging

2. **`ChipSelector`** - Multi-select or single-select chips
   - Horizontal scrolling row of tappable pills
   - Used by: Triggers (multi-select), Location (single-select)

3. **`PickerWheelInput`** - Context-aware amount picker
   - SwiftUI `Picker` with `.wheel` style
   - Dynamic ranges based on ROA (0.5→5.0 for bowls, 5mg→100mg for edibles)
   - Used by: Usage logging (amount field)

4. **`IntensitySlider`** - 1-10 slider with visual feedback
   - Color-coded: 1-3 green (mild), 4-6 yellow (moderate), 7-9 orange (strong), 10 red (overwhelming)
   - Haptic feedback on value change
   - Used by: Craving logging (intensity field)

5. **`TimestampPicker`** - Date/time picker with "Now" default
   - Auto-populates to current time
   - Shows warning if >7 days in past (clinical memory reliability threshold)
   - Used by: Both craving and usage logging

6. **`ChartCard`** - Reusable dashboard metric container
   - Title + subtitle + Swift Charts visualization
   - Tap to expand detail view
   - Used by: All 11 dashboard metrics

7. **`EmptyStateView`** - Placeholder for no data
   - Friendly illustration + message + optional CTA
   - Used by: Dashboard (< 7 days of data), Recordings (no recordings yet)

8. **`PrimaryActionButton`** - Large, clear CTA
   - Minimum 44x44pt tap target (Apple HIG)
   - High contrast, accessible
   - Used by: "Log Craving", "Log Usage", "Record" buttons

**Note on ROA Selection:** Uses native SwiftUI `List` with radio buttons (not a custom component). Single-select vertical list pattern - all 6 options visible, large tap targets, clear "pick one" affordance.

---

### **3. Crisis-Optimized UX Principles**

**Users may be in crisis → Design for cognitive load:**

✅ **Large Tap Targets** - Minimum 44x44pt (Apple HIG standard)
✅ **Clear Primary Actions** - One obvious next step per screen
✅ **Minimal Decisions** - Default to "Now" for timestamp, pre-populate common choices
✅ **Quick Escape** - Swipe-to-dismiss sheets (don't trap users)
✅ **Progressive Disclosure** - Required fields first, optional fields below divider
✅ **Instant Feedback** - Save confirmation, haptic feedback on actions

---

### **4. Accessibility (Non-Negotiable)**

✅ **Dynamic Type** - All text scales with user settings (1x → 7x size)
✅ **SF Symbols** - Native icons that adapt to dark mode, size, weight
✅ **VoiceOver Support** - All buttons labeled, forms navigable
✅ **High Contrast** - Works in light mode, dark mode, increased contrast
✅ **Reduced Motion** - Respects accessibility settings (no essential info in animations)

---

### **5. Performance Targets**

- **Craving log**: <10 sec (required fields only)
- **Usage log**: <10 sec (required fields only)
- **Dashboard load**: <2 sec (even with 90+ days of data)
- **Recording start**: <1 sec (tap "Record" → camera active)

---

### **6. Privacy Messaging**

**Persistent reassurance across all screens:**
- Onboarding: "All data stays on your device. No cloud sync."
- Location permission request: "Location data never leaves your device."
- Settings: "Your data is private and local-only."

---

## 🧭 User Flows (7 Features)

### **Flow 1: First Launch & Onboarding**

**Goal:** Get user to first craving/usage log in <60 seconds

**Screens:**

#### Screen 1.1: Welcome
**Layout:**
- [ ] App icon + name
- [ ] Tagline: "Private cannabis tracking and support"
- [ ] Subtext: "All data stays on your device. No cloud sync."
- [ ] Primary button: "Get Started"
- [ ] Skip button: "Skip Tour" (goes straight to Home)

**Navigation:**
- Tap "Get Started" → Screen 1.2 (Optional Tour)
- Tap "Skip Tour" → Home tab (Flow 2)

---

#### Screen 1.2: Optional Tour (Swipeable Cards)
**Layout:**
- [ ] Card 1: "Track Cravings" - Illustration + "Log intensity, triggers, location in <10 seconds"
- [ ] Card 2: "Track Usage" - Illustration + "Track what you use, when, and why"
- [ ] Card 3: "Record Motivational Content" - Illustration + "Create videos/audio to watch during cravings"
- [ ] Card 4: "See Your Patterns" - Illustration + "Insights emerge after 7 days of tracking"
- [ ] Bottom: "Done" button

**Navigation:**
- Swipe through cards (optional, skippable)
- Tap "Done" → Home tab (Flow 2)

**Note:** Permissions (camera/mic/location) requested CONTEXTUALLY when first needed, NOT here

---

### **Flow 2: Home Tab (Daily Hub)**

**Goal:** Fast access to primary actions (log craving, log usage, record)

**Screen 2.1: Home (With Recordings)**

│─────────────────────────────────│
│        [SAVE USAGE]             │  ← Primary CTA button
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Components:**
- `LogFormSheet` (bottom sheet wrapper - SAME as craving)
- Radio button list for ROA (vertical list, single-select)
- `PickerWheelInput` (context-aware amount picker)
- `TimestampPicker` (auto "now", editable - SAME as craving)
- `ChipSelector` (triggers: multi-select, location: single-select - SAME as craving)
- Text field for notes (SAME as craving)
- `PrimaryActionButton` (SAVE USAGE)

**ROA → Amount Picker Mapping:**
- **Bowls/Joints/Blunts:** 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 (10 options)
- **Vape:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 pulls (10 options)
- **Dab:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 dabs (5 options)
- **Edible:** 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30... 95, 100 mg (20 options)

**Interaction Details:**
- Form scrolls vertically (all fields accessible)
- Required fields at top (progressive disclosure - UX PARITY with craving)
- Visual divider separates required from optional (UX PARITY)
- ROA radio buttons: Tap to select, auto-deselects previous
- **When ROA changes:** Amount picker fades out (0.1s) → New range fades in (0.1s)
- Amount picker shows unit label based on ROA:
  - Bowls/Joints/Blunts → "(bowls/joints)"
  - Vape → "(pulls)"
  - Dab → "(dabs)"
  - Edible → "(mg THC)"
- Timestamp defaults to "Now", tap to edit (date/time picker)
- If timestamp >7 days: Show warning "Memory may be less reliable for events >7 days ago"
- Trigger chips: Multi-select (SAME behavior as craving)
- Location chips: Single-select (SAME behavior as craving)
- Notes field: 500 character limit, character counter at 400 chars (SAME as craving)
- Swipe down anywhere → Dismiss sheet (data not saved, no confirmation)

**Navigation:**
```
User taps [SAVE USAGE]
  ↓
Haptic feedback (success vibration)
  ↓
Bottom sheet dismisses (slides down, 0.3s)
  ↓
Toast appears: "Usage logged ✓" (2s auto-dismiss, top of screen)
  ↓
User back on Home tab
```

**Edge Cases:**
- If ROA not selected → Default to first option (Bowls/Joints/Blunts)
- If amount not set → Default to first value in picker range
- If timestamp not edited → Uses "Now" (default)
- If location "Current" tapped but permission denied → Show alert "Location permission required. Enable in Settings?" (Yes/No)

**UX Parity Notes:**
- ✅ Same `LogFormSheet` component as craving
- ✅ Same divider pattern (required | optional)
- ✅ Same trigger/location chips (multi/single-select)
- ✅ Same timestamp picker behavior
- ✅ Same notes field (500 char limit)
- ✅ Same save feedback (haptic + toast)
- **Difference:** ROA + Amount fields (unique to usage logging)

### **Flow 5: Recordings Tab**

**Goal:** Record motivational content, play during cravings

**Screen 5.1: Recordings Library (Empty State)**
**Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│       🎥                        │  ← Icon

│  "Create motivational content   │  ← Description
│   to play during cravings"      │
│                                 │
│     [RECORD YOUR FIRST]         │  ← Primary CTA button
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Components:**
- `EmptyStateView` (icon + message + CTA)
- `PrimaryActionButton` (RECORD YOUR FIRST)

**Navigation:**
- Tap [RECORD YOUR FIRST] → Screen 5.2 (Permission Request Flow)

---

**Screen 5.2: Permission Request Flow (Contextual)**

**First-Time Flow:**
```
User taps [RECORD YOUR FIRST]
  ↓
Check camera permission status
  ↓
IF permission NOT determined (first time):
  Show iOS system alert:
  "Cravey would like to access the camera"
  [Don't Allow] [OK]
  ↓
  IF user taps [OK]:
    Check microphone permission status
    ↓
    IF mic permission NOT determined:
      Show iOS system alert:
      "Cravey would like to access the microphone"
      [Don't Allow] [OK]
      ↓
      IF user taps [OK]:
        → Screen 5.3 (Recording Screen)
      ELSE (mic denied):
        Show alert: "Microphone required for recordings.
                     You can still record video-only in Settings."
        [Go to Settings] [Cancel]
        → Return to Screen 5.1
    ELSE (mic already granted):
      → Screen 5.3 (Recording Screen)
  ELSE (camera denied):
    Show alert: "Camera required for video recordings.
                 Enable in Settings to record video,
                 or record audio-only instead."
    [Go to Settings] [Record Audio Only] [Cancel]
    ↓
    IF [Record Audio Only]:
      Check mic permission (follow mic flow above)
    ELSE:
      → Return to Screen 5.1

ELSE (permissions already granted):
  → Screen 5.3 (Recording Screen)
```

**Permission States:**
- **Both granted:** Go straight to recording screen
- **Camera denied, mic granted:** Offer audio-only recording
- **Camera granted, mic denied:** Offer video-only recording (silent)
- **Both denied:** Show "Enable in Settings" with deep link

**Edge Cases:**
- User can record audio-only without camera permission
- User can record video-only (silent) without mic permission (edge case, probably not useful clinically)
- "Go to Settings" button deep-links to app settings page

---

**Screen 5.3: Recording Mode Choice Modal**

User has completed permission checks. Now they choose video or audio recording.

**Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Choose Recording Type          │  ← Header
│                                 │
│     [🎥 RECORD VIDEO]           │  ← Full width button

│     [🎙️ RECORD AUDIO]           │  ← Full width button
│                                 │
│     [Cancel]                    │  ← Text button (bottom)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Components:**
- Modal sheet (not full-screen)
- Two `PrimaryActionButton` instances
- Cancel text button

**Navigation:**
```
Tap [RECORD VIDEO] → Screen 5.3.1 (Video Recording Screen)
Tap [RECORD AUDIO] → Screen 5.3.2 (Audio Recording Screen)
Tap [Cancel] → Return to Screen 5.1 (Library)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- Upfront choice prevents accidental wrong-mode recording
- Clear visual distinction (video emoji vs audio emoji)
- Prevents camera preview loading for audio-only users (privacy)
- Simple, one-time decision (mode locked once chosen)

---

**Screen 5.3.1: Video Recording Screen**

User tapped [RECORD VIDEO]. Camera preview active.

**Layout (Before Recording):**

│     [⏹ STOP]                    │  ← Stop button (red square)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Interaction Details:**
- Camera preview shows front-facing camera by default (user sees themselves)
- Timer shows 00:00 before recording starts
- Tap [⏺ RECORD] → Recording starts immediately, button changes to [⏹ STOP], timer increments
- Tap [⏹ STOP] → Recording stops, navigate to Screen 5.3.3 (Preview)
- Tap ✕ (before recording) → Confirm "Discard and return to library?" → Yes/No
- During recording, ✕ is disabled (must stop recording first)

**Technical Notes:**
- Uses AVCaptureSession for video recording
- Front camera default (user records message to themselves)
- Saves to .mov file in Documents/Recordings/
- No pause/resume (keeps it simple for MVP)

**Components:**
- Native video/audio player (inline preview, not full-screen)
- Text fields for title and notes
- `ChipSelector` for purpose (single-select, optional)
- Cancel button (✕)
- `PrimaryActionButton` (SAVE)

**Interaction Details:**
- Preview player loads automatically (paused state)
- Tap [▶ Play] → Plays recording in preview (user can verify it worked)
- Title field is optional, blank by default
- Notes field is optional, blank by default
- Purpose chips are optional, none selected by default
- All fields are scrollable (form scrolls vertically)

**Save Logic:**
```
Tap [SAVE]:
  IF title field has text:
    → Save with custom title
  ELSE (title blank):
    → Auto-generate title: "Recording Oct 25, 2025 3:42 PM"

  Save recording metadata to SwiftData:
    - RecordingModel.title (custom or auto-generated)
    - RecordingModel.notes (if entered)
    - RecordingModel.purpose (if selected)
    - RecordingModel.timestamp (now)
    - RecordingModel.duration (calculated from file)
    - RecordingModel.filePath (relative path to .mov or .m4a)
    - RecordingModel.type ("video" or "audio")
    - RecordingModel.playCount = 0

  File already saved during recording:
    - Documents/Recordings/video_[UUID].mov OR
    - Documents/Recordings/audio_[UUID].m4a

  → Toast: "Recording saved ✓" (2s)
  → Navigate to Screen 5.4 (Library with recordings)
```

**Cancel Flow:**
```
Tap ✕:
  → Show alert: "Discard recording? This cannot be undone."
     [Cancel] [Discard]

  IF [Discard]:
    → Delete file from Documents/Recordings/
    → Return to Screen 5.1 (Library)

  IF [Cancel]:
    → Return to preview screen (no action)
```

**Edge Cases:**
- Title max 40 characters (enforced by text field)
- Notes max 200 characters (character counter appears at 150 chars)
- If user replays recording multiple times before saving, playCount stays 0 (increments only from library)
- Purpose chips: Tap to select, tap again to deselect (optional = can save with none selected)

```

**Components:**
- Header with [+ NEW] button (tap → Screen 5.3, mode choice modal)
- List of recording rows (chronological, newest first)
- Each row shows:
  - Icon (🎥 video or 🎙️ audio)
  - Title (custom or auto-generated)
  - Timestamp + Duration
  - Play count

**Interaction Details:**
- **Tap row anywhere** → Play recording immediately (Screen 5.4.1, playback)
- **Swipe left on row** → [🗑️ Delete] button appears
- **Long-press on row** → Context menu appears:
  - "Edit Title & Notes"
  - "Delete"
  - "Cancel"
- **Tap [+ NEW]** → Navigate to Screen 5.3 (mode choice modal)

**Sorting:**
- Default: Chronological DESC (newest first)
- **MVP Note:** No sorting UI (tabs, filters). This can be added in v2 if users have 20+ recordings.
  - Potential v2: Tabs for "Most Played" / "Recent" / "All"
  - Data model already tracks playCount and timestamp, so sorting is trivial to add

**Screen 5.4.1: Recording Playback (Video)**

User tapped a video recording from library.

**Playback Experience:**
```
Full-screen native video player (AVPlayerViewController)
  - Standard iOS video controls (play/pause, scrub, volume, AirPlay)
  - Swipe down to dismiss
  - Tap anywhere → Show/hide controls
  - Rotate to landscape (automatic, if supported)
  - Native picture-in-picture support (iOS default)
```

**Post-Playback Actions:**
```
On dismiss (swipe down or tap Done):
  → Increment RecordingModel.playCount += 1
  → Update RecordingModel.lastPlayedAt = now
  → Save to SwiftData
  → Return to Screen 5.4 (Library)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use `AVPlayerViewController` (native iOS)
- Load video from `Documents/Recordings/video_[UUID].mov`
- Zero custom UI needed (iOS handles everything)
- Playback increments play count (feeds Top 3 Most Played algorithm for home screen)

  → Save to SwiftData
  → Return to Screen 5.4 (Library)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use AVPlayer with custom UI (bottom sheet)
- Load audio from `Documents/Recordings/audio_[UUID].m4a`
- Waveform visualization using audio meter levels
- Background playback NOT enabled (user must keep app open)

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Components:**
- Bottom sheet (similar to post-recording preview)
- Text fields pre-filled with existing data
- `ChipSelector` for purpose (single-select, shows current selection)
- `PrimaryActionButton` (SAVE CHANGES)

**Interaction Details:**
- Sheet slides up from bottom
- Title field pre-filled (user can edit)
- Notes field pre-filled if exists, else blank
- Purpose chips show current selection (if exists)
- Tap [SAVE CHANGES] → Update RecordingModel → Toast "Updated ✓" → Dismiss sheet
- Tap ✕ → Dismiss sheet without saving (no confirmation needed)
- Swipe down → Dismiss sheet without saving

**Save Logic:**
```
Tap [SAVE CHANGES]:
  Update RecordingModel:
    - title (new value from text field)
    - notes (new value from text field, can be blank)
    - purpose (new selection from chips, can be none)

  Save to SwiftData
  → Toast: "Recording updated ✓" (2s)
  → Dismiss sheet
  → Return to Screen 5.4 (Library, updated row visible)
```

**Edge Cases:**
- If user clears title field (makes it blank), revert to auto-generated title on save
- Character limits enforced by text fields (40 title, 200 notes)
- Purpose can be deselected (tap selected chip to unselect)

---

**Screen 5.4.4: Delete Recording Confirmation**

User swiped left on recording row → Tapped [🗑️ Delete] OR long-pressed → Tapped "Delete".

**Layout:**
```
Alert (system iOS alert):

"Delete 'Don't Fucking Do It'?"
"This recording will be permanently deleted. This cannot be undone."

[Cancel]  [Delete]
          ↑ Red destructive button
```

**Interaction Flow:**
```
Tap [Delete]:
  → Delete RecordingModel from SwiftData
  → Delete file from Documents/Recordings/video_[UUID].mov (or .m4a)
  → Toast: "Recording deleted" (2s)
  → Row animates out of list
  → If library now empty, show Screen 5.1 (empty state)

Tap [Cancel]:
  → Dismiss alert
  → Return to Screen 5.4 (Library, no changes)
```

**Technical Notes:**
- Alert uses custom title (interpolates recording.title)
- Deletion is atomic: Both database record AND file must be deleted
- If file deletion fails, rollback database deletion (maintain consistency)
- If last recording deleted, library reverts to empty state (Screen 5.1)

---

### **Flow 6: Progress Dashboard Tab**

**Goal:** Visualize patterns and progress through data-driven insights

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Show all metrics from Day 1 (no "7 days required" gating)
- ✅ Single scrollable feed (all 11 metrics, prioritized order)
- ✅ Sticky date filter (always visible when scrolling)
- ✅ Static charts for MVP (no tap interactions, defer to v2)
- ✅ Contextual insights even with sparse data (2 data points = actionable feedback)

```

**Date Filter Interaction:**
```
User taps [30D]:
  → Chip highlights (fills with accent color)
  → Previously selected chip ([7D]) unhighlights
  → ALL charts below reload with 30-day data
  → Filter bar stays visible when scrolling (sticky behavior)
  → User can change filter mid-scroll without scrolling back to top
```

**Chart Rendering (Static for MVP):**
```
- Charts render data visually (line charts, pie charts, bar charts)
- No tap interactions, no tooltips, no zoom (static images)
- User scrolls past charts to consume at a glance
- Trends visible in visual SHAPE (slope, dominant slice, tall bars)
- Defer interactivity to v2 (Swift Charts makes this 1-line upgrade)
```

**Sparse Data Handling (Contextual Insights):**
```
EXAMPLE 1: User has 2 cravings logged (Day 2)

Craving Intensity Chart:
  [Line chart with 2 points: 8/10, 6/10]

  IF last < first:
    → "Your intensity dropped from 8/10 to 6/10. That's progress! 📉"
  ELSE IF last > first:
    → "Intensity increased to 6/10. Recovery isn't linear - you're learning. 💪"
  ELSE:
    → "Consistent intensity (8/10). Tracking helps you spot patterns over time."

Location Patterns:
  [2 points, both "Home"]

  → "Both cravings at Home. Environmental cues matter! 🏠"

Trigger Patterns:
  [2 points, both "Anxiety"]

  → "Anxiety triggered both cravings. This is your main pattern right now."

---

EXAMPLE 2: User has 0 logs (Day 1, fresh install)

Summary Card:
  → "0 Cravings • 0 Usage Events"
  → "Start logging to see your patterns! 💪"

Charts:
  → Render empty chart frames with encouraging messages:
  → "Log your first craving to see intensity trends! 📈"
  → "Track usage to see your reduction over time! 📉"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
```swift
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack(pinnedViews: [.sectionHeaders]) {  // ← Sticky filter
        Section(header: DateRangeFilter()) {       // ← [7D] [30D] [90D] [All]

            UsageReductionCard(percentage: reductionPercent)
        }
    }
}

// Contextual Insight Logic (~50 lines total across all metrics)
func contextualInsight(for data: [CravingData]) -> String {
    guard data.count >= 2 else {
        return "Keep logging! Trends become clearer with more data. 💪"
    }

    let first = data.first!.intensity
    let last = data.last!.intensity

    if last < first {
        return "Your intensity dropped from \(first)/10 to \(last)/10. That's progress! 📉"
    } else if last > first {
        return "Intensity increased to \(last)/10. Recovery isn't linear - you're learning. 💪"
    } else {
        return "Consistent intensity (\(first)/10). Tracking helps you spot patterns."
    }
}
```

**Navigation:**
```
- No drill-down screens (all metrics on one scrollable page)
- Tap date filter chip → Charts reload
- No other interactions (charts are static)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **Single feed:** User sees all progress in one scroll (Apple Health pattern)
- **Sticky filter:** Always know what date range is active, change mid-scroll
- **Static charts:** 90% of value (visual trends) for 10% complexity (no gestures)
- **Contextual insights:** Even 2 data points reveal patterns (clinically sound)
- **Show from Day 1:** Validates user effort immediately, no "come back later" gating

### **Flow 7: Settings Tab**

**Goal:** Data management, export, and app information

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Simple iOS list pattern (native, familiar, boring = good for Settings)
- ✅ Data export via Share Sheet (maximum flexibility: email, AirDrop, Files)
- ✅ Single confirmation for Delete All Data (clear warning, iOS standard)
- ✅ **AI Chat REMOVED from MVP** (gimmicky, requires API keys, user already has ChatGPT/Claude)

---

#### **Screen 7.1: Main Settings Screen**

**Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Settings                       │  ← Nav title
│─────────────────────────────────│
│  DATA MANAGEMENT                │  ← Section header
│  Export Data                >   │  ← Tappable row
│  Delete All Data            >   │
│─────────────────────────────────│
│  SUPPORT                        │
│  Contact & Feedback         >   │
│  Privacy Policy             >   │
│─────────────────────────────────│
│  ABOUT                          │
│  Version 1.0 (Build 1)          │  ← Not tappable, just info text
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Interaction Details:**
```
Tap "Export Data":
  → Navigate to Screen 7.2 (Export Data flow)

Tap "Delete All Data":
  → Navigate to Screen 7.3 (Delete confirmation)

Tap "Contact & Feedback":
  → Opens mailto: link or web form (TBD)

Tap "Privacy Policy":
  → Opens in-app WebView or Safari (TBD)

"Version 1.0 (Build 1)":
  → Not tappable, static text for debugging/support reference
```

**Technical Notes:**
- Standard SwiftUI `List` with `Section` headers
- Destructive row ("Delete All Data") uses red text color
- Matches iOS Settings app pattern exactly (zero learning curve)

---

#### **Screen 7.2: Export Data Flow**

**Layout (Modal Sheet):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✕                 Export Data  │  ← Sheet header with close button
│─────────────────────────────────│
│  Choose format:                 │
│                                 │
│  ● CSV                          │  ← Radio buttons (single-select)
│  ○ JSON                         │
│                                 │
│  [Export]                       │  ← Primary button (bottom)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Interaction Flow:**
```
User taps "Export Data" from Settings (Screen 7.1):
  → Modal sheet appears (Screen 7.2)

User selects format (CSV or JSON):
  → Radio button fills
  → [Export] button remains enabled

User taps [Export]:
  → App generates file:
      - CSV: cravey_export_2025-10-25.csv
      - JSON: cravey_export_2025-10-25.json

  → File includes:
      - All craving logs (timestamp, intensity, triggers, location, notes, etc.)
      - All usage logs (timestamp, ROA, amount, triggers, location, notes, etc.)
      - Recording metadata (title, timestamp, duration, type, purpose, playCount)
      - NOTE: Recording FILES not included (just metadata)

  → iOS Share Sheet opens immediately
  → User can:
      - Save to Files app
      - Email to self (or therapist)
      - AirDrop to another device
      - Save to Dropbox/Google Drive/iCloud
      - Copy
      - Message

  → User completes share action
  → Sheet dismisses
  → Toast: "Data exported ✓" (2 seconds)
  → Return to Screen 7.1 (Settings)

User taps ✕ (close):
  → Sheet dismisses without exporting
  → Return to Screen 7.1 (Settings)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
```swift
// Format selection state
@State private var selectedFormat: ExportFormat = .csv

// Export button action
func exportData() {
    // Generate file
    let fileURL = FileManager.generateExport(
        format: selectedFormat,
        cravings: cravingData,
        usage: usageData,
        recordings: recordingMetadata
    )

    // Show Share Sheet (ONE LINE)
    showingShareSheet = true
    shareItems = [fileURL]
}

// Share Sheet
.sheet(isPresented: $showingShareSheet) {
    ShareSheet(items: shareItems)
}
```

**Design Rationale:**
- Share Sheet = iOS-native "do whatever" interface
- Handles all use cases (email, AirDrop, save to Files) without custom code
- Prevents "where did my file go?" confusion
- Fewer steps than saving to Files then manually sharing (4 steps vs 9)

#### **Screen 7.3: Delete All Data Confirmation**

**Layout (Alert):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│  Delete All Data?               │  ← Alert title
│                                 │
│  This will permanently delete   │  ← Alert message
│  all cravings, usage logs, and  │     (clear consequences)
│  recordings. This cannot be     │
│  undone.                        │
│                                 │
│  [Cancel]  [Delete]             │  ← Buttons (Delete = destructive red)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Interaction Flow:**
```
User taps "Delete All Data" from Settings (Screen 7.1):
  → Alert appears (Screen 7.3)

User taps [Delete]:
  → Delete ALL data:
      - All CravingModel records (SwiftData)
      - All UsageModel records (SwiftData)
      - All RecordingModel records (SwiftData)
      - All recording FILES (*.mov, *.m4a in Documents/Recordings/)
      - All MotivationalMessageModel custom messages (keep defaults)

  → Deletion is atomic (all-or-nothing, no partial state)

  → Alert dismisses
  → Toast: "All data deleted" (2 seconds)
  → Return to Screen 7.1 (Settings)
  → App state resets to "Day 1" (empty dashboard, empty recordings, etc.)

User taps [Cancel]:
  → Alert dismisses
  → No changes
  → Return to Screen 7.1 (Settings)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
```swift
// Single confirmation alert (iOS standard)
Alert(
    title: "Delete All Data?",
    message: "This will permanently delete all cravings, usage logs, and recordings. This cannot be undone.",
    primaryButton: .destructive(Text("Delete")) {
        deleteAllData()
    },
    secondaryButton: .cancel()
)

// Deletion logic
func deleteAllData() {
    // Delete SwiftData models
    try? modelContext.delete(model: CravingModel.self)
    try? modelContext.delete(model: UsageModel.self)
    try? modelContext.delete(model: RecordingModel.self)

    // Delete recording files
    FileStorageManager.shared.deleteAllRecordings()

    // Save context
    try? modelContext.save()

    // Show confirmation
    showToast("All data deleted")
}
```

**Design Rationale:**
- Single confirmation = sufficient (user navigated deliberately, 6 steps to get here)
- Clear message = explicit consequences (not vague "delete everything?")
- Fresh start is VALID use case (relapse recovery, device switching)
- iOS standard pattern (Apple uses this for "Erase All Content and Settings")
- Atomic deletion = no partial state bugs

## ✅ Status: 100% COMPLETE

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25
**Version:** 1.2

**All Flows Designed (7/7):**
- ✅ General design guidelines (SwiftUI 2025 best practices)
- ✅ Component library defined (8 reusable components)
- ✅ Flow 1: Onboarding (2 screens - Welcome + Optional Tour)
- ✅ Flow 2: Home Tab (2 screens - Primary actions + Quick Play recordings)
- ✅ Flow 3: Log Craving (1 screen - Bottom sheet form, full spec)
- ✅ Flow 4: Log Usage (1 screen - Bottom sheet form, full spec with UX parity)
- ✅ Flow 5: Recordings Tab (10 screens - Complete: Empty state, permissions, mode choice, recording screens, preview/save, library, playback, edit, delete)
- ✅ Flow 6: Progress Dashboard Tab (1 screen - Single scrollable feed with 11 metrics, sticky filters, contextual insights)
- ✅ Flow 7: Settings Tab (3 screens - Main settings, export via Share Sheet, delete confirmation)

**Total Screens Designed:** 19 screens fully specified

**Progress:** 7/7 flows complete (100%) 🎉

---

**Major Design Decisions Locked:**
1. ✅ Crisis-optimized UX (large tap targets, minimal decisions, quick escape)
2. ✅ UX parity between craving/usage logging (same form pattern, learn once)
3. ✅ Progressive disclosure (required → divider → optional fields)
4. ✅ Independent craving and usage flows (no forced linking)
5. ✅ Upfront video/audio mode choice (prevents accidents)
6. ✅ Simple record/stop (no pause, encourages re-recording authenticity)
7. ✅ Optional recording titles with smart defaults (auto-generate if blank)
8. ✅ Native players (AVPlayerViewController, reliable MVP)
9. ✅ Chronological library (sorting deferred to v2)
10. ✅ Dashboard shows from Day 1 (no gating, contextual insights even with 2 data points)
11. ✅ Single scrollable feed (Apple Health pattern, sticky date filters)
12. ✅ Static charts for MVP (defer interactivity to v2)
13. ✅ Share Sheet for export (native, flexible)
14. ✅ Single confirmation for delete (iOS standard)
15. ✅ **AI Chat REMOVED from MVP** (gimmicky, API cost unsustainable, recordings are better)
