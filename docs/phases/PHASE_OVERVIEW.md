# Cravey Implementation Phases - Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** 🚀 READY TO START PHASE 1

---

## 🎯 Phase Strategy

This document breaks down the **TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md** into **6 modular, shippable phases**. Each phase:

✅ Can be **tested independently** (unit + integration + UI tests)
✅ Produces a **shippable deliverable** (users can do something new)
✅ Follows **TDD workflow** (write tests → implement → validate)
✅ Validates **Clean Architecture** compliance (Dependency Rule)

**Shippable:** Users can see progress visualized (11 metrics)
**Features:** Feature 4 (Dashboard)
**Files Created:** 5 files (use case + view + charts)
**Tests:** 8 unit tests, 2 integration tests, 1 UI test

**Key Deliverables:**

## 🔄 TDD Workflow (Every Phase)

```
1. Write Test (RED) ❌
   - Unit test for use case
   - ViewModel test with mock use case
   - UI test for critical flow

2. Implement Minimal Code (GREEN) ✅
   - Domain layer (Entity, Use Case, Protocol)
   - Data layer (Model, Mapper, Repository)
   - Presentation layer (ViewModel, View)

3. Refactor (CLEAN) 🧹
   - Extract helpers
   - Improve naming
   - Add documentation
   - Verify tests still pass

4. Commit (ATOMIC) 📦
   - Small, focused commits
   - Commit message format: "[Phase X] Add feature Y"
   - Push to feature branch
```
